Zen of Python
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
10.Errors should never pass silently.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
20.Beautiful is better than ugly.
21.Explicit is better than implicit.
30.Unless explicitly silenced.
32.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
