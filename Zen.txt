Zen of Python
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
10.Errors should never pass silently.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
20.Beautiful is better than ugly.
30.Unless explicitly silenced.
32.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
