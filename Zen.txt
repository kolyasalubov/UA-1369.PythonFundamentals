Zen of Python
4.Complex is better than complicated. 
5.Flat is better than nested.
6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
10.Errors should never pass silently.
12.In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
20.Beautiful is better than ugly.
21.Explicit is better than implicit.
28.Although practicality beats purity.
30.Unless explicitly silenced.
32.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
51.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
