Zen of Python

6.Sparse is better than dense.
7.Readability counts.
8.Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
14.Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
16.Although never is often better than *right* now.
24.Flat is better than nested.
30.Unless explicitly silenced.
32.There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
